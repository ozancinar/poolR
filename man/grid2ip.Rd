\title{Results from testing the association between depressive symptoms and 23 SNPs in the GRID2IP gene}
\description{Results from testing the association between depressive symptoms (as measured with the CES-D scale) and 23 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GRID2IP gene based on a sample of 886 adolescents (Van Assche et al., 2017).}
\usage{grid2ip.p}
\format{Object \code{grid2ip.p} is a vector with the 23 \eqn{p}-values of the tests (two-sided). Object \code{grid2ip.ld} contains a matrix with the linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlations among the 23 SNPs. \code{grid2ip.geno} is a matrix that contains the genotypes from 886 adoloscents for 23 SNPs (as \code{character} objects). \code{grid2ip.pheno} is a vector with the quantitative phenotype from 886 adoloscents.}
